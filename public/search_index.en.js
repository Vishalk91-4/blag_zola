I present here a list of Applications, for desktop and mobile that I have loved using and would recommend to anyone within a heartbeat.\nMaybe you may already know some of them but perhaps the reasons why I like them would differ from yours, so read on!\nVS Code\n\nI started proper coding with Sublime Text 3 beta. I loved that text editor. It was smooth and beautiful. Then came Atom, another marvel and a beast of another world. A slow behemoth that could do almost anything through extensions.\nAnd recently I was introduced to VS Code. I accept that I did not try it due to Microsoft's badge on it, at first. However, once I started using it I couldn't stop. It was both fast, extensible and more importantly, it got work done. You didn't have to spend hours finding the right extensions and then setting them up. It came with all the essentials included and had great official support for a lot of the languages that I used. The git integration is also awesome and especially helpful for large projects.\nFor anyone that still uses Atom or Sublime Text, switch to VS Code. Just try it and you might never go back.\nTelegram\n\nIn the days of the boom of messaging apps, I tried a lot of them. I tried WhatsApp, Viber, Line, Wechat, Messenger, Hangouts and then I settled on Telegram. There are a few reasons why. Telegram is faster than most of them.\nIt is also secure and has a track record of not sharing data with any government agency or third party. And it has stickers and gifs that are very intuitive and easy to use. Half of my messages on my family's telegram group are using Stickers and GIFs. I recommend it almost everyone.\nUbuntu + i3wm\n\nI have been a strong proponent of everything Linux, and I will not go on and repeat why I like Ubuntu and any Linux distro in general. However, I will present to you a different way of using your laptop: using a tiling window manager. A window manager is a very lightweight application that controls how each window looks and behaves on your desktop.\ni3 is a beginner friendly and fast window manager. I would recommend you to start with i3-gaps (for those cool gaps between windows).\nIn addition to being lightweight, It is fast and uses the screen-space efficiently. Not only is a WM fast in itself, but most WMs also use keybindings so changing windows and virtual desktops (Not VMs mind you) is a breeze. I have thoroughly enjoyed my experience with i3 and I would recommend anyone willing to give a little time to learn how to use it as it is very different from how you regularly use your OS. Here is a brief tutorial about i3 which helped me get started.\nTypora\n\nTypora is a minimal markdown editor. But as Mr. Nicholas Burroughs aptly said:\n\n\"Minimalism is not a lack of something. It’s simply the perfect amount of something.\"\n\nTypora is just the right amount of markdown editor you need. It behaves similar to a WYSIWYG editor but hides its features behind a set of keybindings and views. It is simple to use if you are familiar with markdown and very very enjoyable for distraction-free writing. In fact, I have written this post on Typora itself and I have even created a theme for it.\nAlto's Adventure\n\nLet's throw in a game for some fun. Alto's Adventure is the game that I play. I don't have any other games on my phone and even though I don't play it often nowadays, this is my favorite game so far on Android. It is an infinite runner where you can jump and do backflips. But don't let the simplicity distract you. With a marvelous soundtrack and a phenomenal procedurally generated environment, It will surely make your evenings a hell lot of fun. Also, don't forget to try Zen Mode.\nJoey for Reddit\n\nAnother Android Reddit app. But Joey has the highest ratings on the play store (4.9 / 5). And there are plenty of reasons why; highly customizable, fast, gesture-based, fullscreen immersive content. It is a fun app and makes the Reddit experience on mobile fantastic. If you are a Redditor you should definitely check this App.\nFigma\n\nFigma is a design tool. It is a fast prototyping software and is available as an online app. It is very easy and intuitive and has great videos on getting started. It is free for all the basic usage and I have had a great time using it. I have recently started designing a lot more on figma and my previous pick was Inkscape, which wasn't so nice as it had a few performance issues and it was a vector drawing application, not exactly a design app.\nEboox Ebook reader\n\nAnother Android app, it is an eBook Reader and that's it. Eboox has very basic book management but where it excels is the reading experience. It is simply exceptional, with the included \"Tinos\" font, it is a great and minimal Ebook reader for mobile. You can highlight quotes and put bookmarks too. But the reason I like this app is that it does one thing and it does it very well.\nYoutube Vanced\n\nI know you are smart and you have an adblocker installed on your browser. But what about mobile? You can't prevent ads from showing up on Youtube on mobile, but can you? Youtube vanced is a perfect replacement for youtube albeit with a few minor tweaks, a true black dark mode, ability to play higher resolution videos than supported, the ability for background playback (you can let the app play the video as a music player in your notifications!) but most importantly no adds.\nAs most of you might have guessed by now, no it is not available on Play Store and for obvious reasons. Hence, you have to side-load it and do a minor setup if you want to login using your Google account. However, I think it is worth the effort and is simply fantastic.\n\nFun fact Youtube Vanced = Youtube Advanced - Ad\n\n\nThat might be all that I have, for now, If I get to experience anything else, I will make sure to share it in another blog post!\n","id":"http://127.0.0.1:1111/posts/apps-that-i-love/","title":"Apps that I Love"},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/posts/chessproblems/":{"body":"cover:\nimage: /blag/images/chess-problems.png\nstyle: wide\ncaption: Rendered using Blender\ntags: - tech - blender - chess\nSo I was interested in this chess puzzle:\n\nIn this very peculiar position we have to place the black king to a square such that it is not in check and with white being next to move black gets mated in the maximum number of moves. That is white takes most moves to mate black.\nTo solve such a problem, we can take help of our friend Stockfish. Using the online chess website Lichess's analysis and editor features, we can determine the number of moves to mate for all the available squares.\nDoing such an analysis and collecting the data we get the following chart:\n\nWhich seems quite interesting and promising as we can then deduce that the safest place for the black king is in the upper right center of the board. Moreover, we see that the squares near the pieces and the edge of the board have lower values as they are places where the black king gets checkmated quickly.\nWe can then create a 3D representation of this data by giving the squares the height of the numbers in them. Using some blender magic we get the following in 3D:\n\nWhich is quite nice to look at. The 4 squares with value of 8 can be seen to dominate and they are surrounded by squares of gradually decreasing height. The transparency gives the feel of volume, and a look on squares hidden from view.\nA bit more playing at blender's materials and shading we can beautify the image further:\n\nI went ahead and created the white pieces for reference to the problem and we get:\n\nWe have this final detailed infographic about the entire thing in one image:\n\nExtras\nA few changes in the cameras location and focus gives us these few spectacular shots:\n\n\nAnd now since I have all the pieces created for chess, I setup an entire board with the starting position in blender:\n\nTaking careful look at both the king and the queen, both of them looked out of proportion and awkward. Hence they were modified and we got a new nice setup:\n\nAnd there is one more angle for the last render:\n\nHere is the imgur album for all the images: https://imgur.com/a/kvxUJW6\n","id":"http://127.0.0.1:1111/posts/chessproblems/","title":"Visualizing a problem in Chess"},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/posts/design-tips/":{"body":"cover:\nimage: /blag/images/design-tips/design-tips-cover.jpg\nstyle: wide\nHi, I have been practicing the art of designing web pages for a long time (a few years at least). And I have made some (objective term) progress. Here I would present some resources that you can go through to help in designing websites. Also, I would recommend a few tips which would help you boost your design.\nObservation\nThe first good skill that you need to obtain to start designing is Observation. Look and Observe how others have designed their websites. Also, do not limit yourself to a standard site such as Google or Facebook for design inspiration. You can browse these sites for a taste of what good design looks like:\n\nCSS Design Awards Look here for the best of the best, But Don't be overwhelmed and depressed. These are the best-designed websites\nCSS Mania\nCSSDSGN\nHTML5up I would recommend only to observe the design and if needed download and learn how to design a specific thing rather than copy-pasting the whole template. You would complete the website; But would you learn?\n\nAnother amazing tool to help you in the task of observation is Developer Tools. These are available in all major browsers. Chrome DevTools and Firefox Developer Tools. A cool tip to note: you can add new styles in DevTools and see them updated live on the webpage, Awesome for testing different colors padding etc to see what fits right. (Note that changing code in DevTools does not change it in your files)\nUnderstanding color\n\nWhile I agree that color theory is a vast topic and I don't quite understand all of it, I still can recommend a few websites from where I have developed my sense of color:\n\n\nColor Theory for Designers - Smashing Magazine \nI love the Smashing Magazine Blog. They cover detailed explanations and examples of design. And this blog series, in particular, is a gem. I have developed most of my color choice from these articles. Make sure you read all three!\n\n\nA Simple Web Developer's Color Guide\nAnother article from Smashing Magazine. Nice and simple.\n\n\nEnough about theory what about Tools?\n\nColorHexa - Literally they say themselves as a color encyclopedia\nPALETTABLE - Create a color palette by liking/disliking (It ain't FB)\nCOLOURlovers - The site where I found great colors. Also, check out the Top palettes on this site, they are beautiful.\nAdobe Color CC - Don't Worry it's free! It's also amazing, especially for extracting color from images.\nGPick - I use this tool a lot to collect the colors I love. It's available in Ubuntu repos as gpick\n\nUsing Fonts\n\nThe most dramatic effect of any one thing on design is that of the font. (Just think of designing something in Comic sans except of course Comics). I really like typefaces. And here are some sites to learn more about them:\n\nDesign Theory: 5 Basic Principles of Typography - Sums up the basic points of using typefaces\nWebdesign\nChoosing the Right Font: A Practical Guide to Typography on the Web\n\nGetting the right fonts is not a headache, thanks to Google Fonts. It's an amazing site from where you can download and even link your fonts through CSS/link tags so that the font is shown in your client's browser even if they haven't installed it!\nThere are a few other sites that provide free fonts but most of them either are free for personal use or cost some $Dolla.\nI also compiled a set of great fonts available on Google fonts when I created the FontStaller script. You can find them here.\nTips n Tricks\nMinimalism is the way to go\n\nMinimalism is not a lack of something. It’s simply the perfect amount of something. — Nicholas Burroughs\n\nBy having a lot of things on the website at the same time confuses people and gives a sense of clutter and disorder. Put something there only if it needs to be there. Simplify Reduce Iterate. Just look at Wikipedia. It isn't quiet aesthetic as other sites and looks like a mess in the modern age. Whereas a quick look at Google explains the point of simplicity.\n\n\nBut don't remove everything. As once a great man said:\n\nEverything should be made as simple as possible, but not simpler. - Albert Einstein\n\nTest different screen sizes\n\nI know it is hard to design for your own screen size, much harder to design for several. But that is what makes or breaks a design. People would not just be browsing your website from your specific machine. They might use a phone a tablet or unfortunately a smart-TV. Make your website at least a little mobile friendly by adding a few media tags.\nAdvance stuff : Sass\nEver since I learned about Sass, I have used it everywhere. It is a CSS preprocessor. By that I mean, it is a language that compiles to generate CSS. But why would we need something else? Because it simplifies things. Here is the official guide if you are feeling curious.\nUse some extensions\nI know editing CSS files is not that hard, you don't need extra debugging stuff and linters. But a few extensions do make the job easier. These are a few extensions that I use in Atom:\n\ncolor-picker I love this plugin\npigments this one too\ncss-snippets\n language-CSS  This comes as preinstalled.\n\nThanks for reading, Hope I might have been of some assistance in your Aim to nail down the best design ever!\n","id":"http://127.0.0.1:1111/posts/design-tips/","title":"Design Tips"},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/posts/designing-a-poster/":{"body":"cover:\nimage: /blag/images/designing-a-poster.png\nstyle: full\ncaption: visit posters.xypnox.com to view all posters.\ntags:\n\ndesign\n\n\nTo design a good poster, you have to design 100 bad posters first.\n\nI have been making posters for a couple of years. And I have learned a lot, not just about how to make a good poster, but also why most posters are bad. And here I present a minimal guide on how to make nice posters.\nI should say upfront that I am not a great designer. What you see is a combination of years of bad design and a genuine interest in creating something better than before. If you are interested in viewing some of my posters, you can visit posters.xypnox.com.\n\nA while ago a junior from KOSS asked me the following:\nHey xypnox,\nI am very interested in designing beautiful things like the new design you made for koss Can u please guide how should I start?\nAnd I replied:\nHi!\nI apologize for the very late response.\nI currently use Inkscape to create the posters and designs that I have made for KOSS. It is a free and Open Source tool so you can easily use it.\nThe first thing about design is not about creating but observing. I have spent far more time looking at and appreciating good design throughout all the mediums, be it physical like posters, book covers, product wrappers, devices, cars, etc to digital like websites, apps, videos, music cover-arts, etc. The places that you can take inspiration from are endless. You will slowly develop a sense of what looks beautiful and what doesn't.\nI can list you a few rules but they wouldn't capture everything and will only be recommendations and they can still be broken. The point is that you should start observing and create designs just for the sake of creating them. I used to do this a lot. I would create things that I didn't share anywhere, I just made them to practice and in several instances, test whether I could make something similar to what I had in my mind.\nA blog that I used to read just for fun was: https://www.smashingmagazine.com/\nI still recommend it but it has a lot of content and you don't need to go through everything.\nThe cycle that I would recommend you to follow is Observe -&gt; Learn -&gt; Experiment\nI got to know of graphic design \"forums\" pretty late. As late as the previous year to be exact. A few of them are:\n\nBehance https://www.behance.net/\nDribble https://dribbble.com/\n4chan GD http://boards.4channel.org/gd/\nReddit https://www.reddit.com/r/Design/\n\nI would recommend taking inspiration from these. Specifically, observe what people comment and discuss in the Reddit and 4chan forums.\nAlso, for web design, I use to go at:\n\nhttps://www.awwwards.com/\nhttps://material.io/design/\nhttps://developer.apple.com/design/\n\nHope you have a great time designing awesome stuff. I would love if you could post any drafts in #design channel in slack so we can critique it for improvements.\nI wrote a blog post about design a long time ago about a few things that I thought were important: https://www.xypnox.com/blag/posts/design-tips/ Please don't open this - not in the original message\nRegards,\nxypnox\n\nThis was a while back. And if you don't want to read everything then the message is enough. But if you have not satisfied your hunger, carry on!\nTo Develop a sense of Design\nObserve Good Design\nStart observing good design.\n\nBefore you start to appreciate good design, you should be able to recognize bad design and the ways to correct it.\n\nWe frequently and easily criticize bad design. That a poster is ugly. That an icon is of poor quality. That a website is imperfect. But when it comes to fixing the bad design, we are left clueless. Even a four-year-old can tell you that something doesn't look good. But what exactly doesn't look good is another question entirely. It is a good exercise to not only find that a design is faulty but also find the faults in it.\nPractice, Practice, Practice\nThere is no better substitute for learning to make a poster than actually making a poster. You should experiment with making a poster when you don't have to make a poster. Try different styles, try replicating an idea you saw earlier, try experimenting with color, typography, alignment. You are free to practice with your heart's content.\nWhat is there to lose in experimenting? Nothing. Everything is freely available. You can grab stock images from Unsplash, Try colors from Adobe Colors, Fonts from Google fonts. Nothing is stopping you from designing good posters other than you yourself. In fact, all the recent posters I have designed were created from free stuff using free software such as Figma and Inkscape.\nMaking a Poster\nThe first step of the design process is not to open your favorite software and start making a nice poster. The principle step involves thought. You have to start thinking - What you are making? Who are you making it for? What is the main concern? Is this the only way to do it? - These questions help you justify the poster and the decisions you shall make while designing it.\nWho are your final consumers?\nWho will be finally looking at your design? - Your target audience decides most of the boundaries that you can explore.\nAfter determining your audience's demographics, decide what they want, what they like, what they are interested in and what will make them happy. Answering these questions will go a far way in relieving you from minor headaches such as Which fonts to use, What should be the alignment, Is a modern style good or the Skeuomorphic real-life style better?\nBut, it is also important to remember that you are designing for yourself first. Every poster you make should look good to you. If it doesn't, then it is not your best design. And if it does look good, chances are it will look good to others too.\nWhat is the main problem?\nThere is a main problem that every design intends to solve. With most posters, it is grabbing the attention of the audience and encouraging them to read the complete poster.\nHence, you want your poster to be as catchy as possible. It should be able to stop someone from scrolling over to actually read what is written on the poster. To make a poster catchy, it is not necessary to make it visually perfect. However, the reader is more likely to read a \"legible\" poster than a \"flashy\" one.\n\nDon't make the poster too :fire: FLASHY :star:\n\nWhat should be the main theme of the poster?\nThe main theme of the poster sets the stage for everything afterward. The main theme decides which colors to use which fonts would work and what the borders and backgrounds should look like. By theme, I refer to the abstract idea or feeling conveyed through the poster. Such as strong solid lines and bordered and clean text are suitable for an official and formal theme.\nYour main theme should cater to the audience and should look to solve the main challenge. After you choose the theme, the next steps are building upon the idea and making it into a poster.\nLearn the tools, or perhaps don't\nIt is a weird notion that people have to learn every nook and cranny of Photoshop before making a poster. I don't use Photoshop. And I don't get why people are so devoted to it. You don't have to know Photoshop or even use Photoshop to create great posters.\n\nThe best tools are useless in the hands of an idiot.\n\nBut that doesn't mean you have to abandon Photoshop altogether. What I mean is that Photoshop is too \"good\" for what we are trying to do. It has a thousand features that we may never use, It has a multitude of ways of doing something basic - confusing users of which is the right way. You can stick with Photoshop if you want but I would suggest trying Inkscape and Figma as well. Both are excellent vector graphics editors and guess what they are absolutely free.\nAlso, You don't need to know everything to start designing. You should have a basic knowledge of how to create shapes, add text, change the font, add images, use layers and gradients, etc. But nothing too fancy is necessary. The reason is that you shall learn the rest by experimenting and creating posters. Whenever you want to do something in your editor, and you don't know how to do it, just google how to do it.\nYou will never find a video or a tutorial teaching you to make beautiful things that will instantly make you better. You can learn how to use a tool and yet you won't be able to design anything awesome just by the knowledge of using the tool. It is like the difference in learning to write and writing a magnum opus. You can only acquire it with time.\nTypography\nThe most under-appreciated part of designing posters: Typography. Even though it is boring, it is just plain text, it is just some words, you can always find ways to spice things up, you can always make the content the best part of your design!\nThis is very close to the core of minimalism, where the focus is on content rather than the ability of content to look good.\nThe basic guidelines for working with text are:\n\nPeople read the thing that attracts their attention first.\nPeople read from left to right.\nPeople expect the important details to be highlighted.\nPeople expect things related to each other to be with each other.\n\nWith these simple principles, we can get a good idea of what our text should be and how we can format it. The Title should be the primary focus grabber and should ideally be the first thing the eyes land on. Whatever the user needs to read or interact with should be prominently visible and legible.\nAnother facet of text is the font. Font is the dress text wears. When your poster is formal, fonts that look professional are recommended. Open Sans, Lato, Crimson, etc are a great choice for a formal setting. And in design, what looks good on a formal design usually, with little modifications also looks good with informal scenarios as well. So the fonts noted above are overall a great choice for several themes.\nIf you want to step into the informal territory you can use a combination of display and handwriting fonts. But, remember to make sure that the text is legible. Nice fonts are nothing if the viewer can't read what is written. It is a good choice to use sans-serif fonts for the smaller sized texts as they are the most readable at a smaller scale.\nDigesting Criticism\nIf you cannot tolerate criticism then, unfortunately, designing is not for you. You will always get an unhealthy dose of criticism for everything that you design. And for beginners, it could be downright un-motivational. Ignore every comment that does not contain suggestions. And those that do, take them with a grain of salt. See if the suggestions actually improve the design. And remember that the final decision to include any change in the poster should rest on you and thus you should choose wisely.\nDon't Do this\nYou can do the things listed below if you are perfectly sure you are not intoxicated, and you understand that actions have consequences.\n\nDon't stick stuff to the very edge.\nDon't use more than 3 colors. (shades and tints are fine)\nDon't use more than 3 fonts.\nDon't use every effect on a single object, like gradient, 3D, Shadow, Glow and Outline on a single piece of text.\nDon't Align everything differently.\n\nAnd there is unique Don't Do This point that needs thorough discussion:\nDon't use templates\nI understand that sometimes you are bored, with only a few minutes left and everyone expects a poster from you. Then, it may be plausible that you take a template from the wen and change the texts and send over the nice poster that you have \"designed\". This is no design.\nNever get yourself in a position like this. You will never create anything of value while you are limited in time. Start early. And with time, perhaps you may develop a knack of designing posters quickly. But till then., begin at least 48 hours before the release of the poster.\nNow, coming back to the main point. DO NOT USE THE DAMN TEMPLATES. Because you learn nothing. Do you think you may have learned a great deal by creating posters using templates? What have you actually learned? Using the font tool to change the text. That's it. And I can guarantee I can make a better poster than a template-driven designer in frigging Microsoft Paint.\n\nTemplates are a great solution for people who don't have time, not for people who claim to be a member of a design team.\n\nTemplates are there to teach you how a poster should look like. They are there for inspiration and imitation. Take ideas from the templates and design a poster yourself. Make the squares and circles and all shapes yourself. You can definitely use icons and imagery etc. You don't have to photograph every picture you use in your poster yourself.\n\n\nWith time you shall learn to design. And with luck and practice, you can become best.\n\nIf you have some suggestions, please comment below or feel free to reach me!\n","id":"http://127.0.0.1:1111/posts/designing-a-poster/","title":"Designing a Poster"},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/posts/fontstaller/":{"body":"tags: - linux - programming\ncover:\nimage: /blag/images/fontstaller-cover.jpg\nstyle: full\nI have had troubles installing fonts in Linux. Although its far easier than Windows where the only way to install a bunch of fonts is to open the file and click install fonts. In Linux however, you can copy your fonts to ~/.fonts or /usr/share/fonts and they will be recognized by all the applications. But can this process be improved or streamlined?\nThe main problem that I was facing was that while many sites offered fonts for free they were usually zipped/archived. Which meant that they would have to be manually unarchived one by one to install the fonts, which considering the number of fonts (36!) I wanted to install at the time was way too much. So clearly I needed a script to unzip and copy the font files in ~/.fonts. The problem was that although the unzip command is fairly straightforward and could be used I didn't have much control over it.\nSo I searched some more and stumbled upon the fact that python comes preloaded with a zip archive reading library named zipfile. And I could use it to spin up a small python script to make the extraction process \"smart\". By smart, I mean that the program could differentiate between a directory containing fonts and archives containing fonts. It can also work with nested directory structure and even detect whether a font has been preinstalled or not.\nThe program itself: FontStaller\n\n\nYou can find the code in the GitHub repo xypnox/fontstaller.\n\nAt the default settings, the Fontstaller script installs the fonts located in the folder fonts in the current directory. It installs all the zips that have a font file. Or any (sub - sub ...) subdirectory (ies) that have a font file (generally ttf, otf).\nThe fonts are by default copied to the folder ~/.fonts. An interesting point to note is that the directory structure of your initial fonts folder is not preserved. This is to simplify distinguishing already installed fonts. This way the script can easily check only folder names in ~/.fonts and doesn't have to deal with subdirectory structure.\nThere are a few command line options to tweak the behavior of the script, they are mentioned as follows:\nargumentdefaultdescription\n-h, --helpshow help message and exit\n--fdir'fonts'directory containing fonts\n--idir'~/.fonts'directory in which fonts will be installed\n--ignorezipIgnore zipped files\n\nI know there are few bugs that still exist. Such as the fact that the script doesn't deal well with subdirectory structure in the archived files. However, it is still quite useful.\nIf you are interested in the fonts I was installing, check this archived zip\n\nTricks\nI learned a few new tricks about python scripting that I would share here.\nSplitting and slicing simultaneously\nYou split and slice simultaneously by just splicing the output of Splitting command. For example, the line in my code that uses it is :\nidir = args.idir + '/' + zfile.split('/')[-1][:-4]\n\nHere I needed only the name of the archive without the .zip extension. So I first split the string using / then slice the last element till the fifth last character. Pretty neat.\nParsing command-line parameters in python\nI know its quite dumb to say it's a trick but it took me several readings of Manual and a few different command line parsing methods to flat this one out. I finally ended up using the argparse package which is a little hard, to begin with, but offers a great amount of flexibility and nice user experience such as auto-generated help command!\nIt is too much, to begin with, so I will simply link to its Manual page in Python : Argparse.\n","id":"http://127.0.0.1:1111/posts/fontstaller/","title":"Fontstaller"},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/posts/happy-new-year/":{"body":"cover:\nimage: /blag/images/new-year.png\ncaption: A Happy New Year Post, Quote from Brainyquotes | Photo by Karl Magnuson on Unsplash, edited by me :)\ntags: - life\nHappy New Year\nThats pretty much it.\nIf you want the full res image you can get it from imgur\nShare the image if you like it, Also add the link to this post.\ni.e. https://git.io/vbbwB\n","id":"http://127.0.0.1:1111/posts/happy-new-year/","title":"Happy New Year"},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/posts/lonely/":{"body":"cover:\nimage: /blag/images/lonely.jpg\ncaption: Photo by Brannon Naito on Unsplash\ntags: - poem\nI see you down the street, alone\nWalking slowly towards me\nIn the cold hazy wind\nThat twirls your hair lightly\nYour eyes stare the drab pavement\nYour light steps make no sound\nYou slightly move your hand to remove\nThe falling hair from your pale face\nAnd my heart skips a beat\nFor a moment you lift your eyes\nAnd we gaze at each other\nI smile, but you have already looked away\nA few seconds pass, while I\nDream of you\nThen I look at you again and I see,\nThe sad pain of loneliness, your eyes\nHave lost the shine they once had\nYour bag full of books is\nDragging you down\nMaybe we can meet someday,\nAnd extinguish our loneliness together\nFor I recognize the suffering, the ache\nOf being lonely\n","id":"http://127.0.0.1:1111/posts/lonely/","title":"Lonely"},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/posts/losing-things/":{"body":"tags: - comic - fun\n\nSome very beautiful things get lost and forgotten.

Feel free to skip this section.\n\nSo, I have tried to find an ideal service with the above features for a long long time. I used to use Evernote a long time ago. In fact It might have been my first note taking app. But that was before I switched to Linux. In linux the scenario becomes a lot tougher. The services available always seem to lack something or another. Either they do not sync, are limited only to linux, or are proprietary. A service that I really liked was Simple Note. It was a very minimal note taking app from the creators of wordpress and had seamless sync between devices. I actually used it to store notes for some time rather than just testing it and hating and moving on.\nBut like every thing in this world, it was imperfect. It was very limited in the type of notes it could store, the management of notes was very primitive. And, simple note didn't use great encryption. At that time, I didn't need a note taking service desperately and hence I slowly stopped using Simple Note. Simple note's desktop client was based on electron.\nLater on, with the improvements in electron, several note taking apps emerged in the wild. I really loved the ideas behind them, Markdown support, minimal design, live rendering to get a WYSIWYG like feel. But the catch was that there was no organization or sync. You just edited a markdown file and saved it to your device. I then started using my text editor (Atom at that time) as my note editor just because one electron was already too much for an old PC. I saved them in the documents folder. No sync no search nothing. (I did not know linux search from command-line because I was used GUI most of the time)\nA few note apps designed specifically for programmers like Larvena, Never got it running, arbicotine, Really liked this one, plus it was open source but developers responded slowly to issues, Boostnote, A very full featured note taking application which was simply overwhelming to my tiny brain, Tag Sapces, What the hell was this? tags for all your files, like seriously? All these applications felt like using a chainsaw to open a can of coke. They aimed to be too ambitious but lacked the basics.\nOn the Android landscape, things weren't any better. The thing with cross-platform applications is that most often you end up with an awesome application on one platform and a barely usable one on others. Very few applications are actually good on all the platforms that they support. Back then, I used to download and install gazillions of applications and I can say that I have tried my fair share of note applications for android. I didn't use Evernote on android because I started using android a long time after I left Evernote for desktop.\nI did encounter a few great applications for android though. The first one was Monospace. It was a minimal markdown note editor. It did a things beautifully, It was unobtrusive and used tags for organization. However It did not have any sync and since I used mobile as a secondary device, it was a deal breaker. I also used apps similar to Monospace, such as JotterPad, Writer+ etc But they were worse than Monospace and I left them in few hours of usage.\nIf a note editing app stood as a great example of design, It would be Material Notes. It was such a beauty to use. The notes were colored and the usage of monospace font was just icing on the cake. But this app didn't do anything else. I used it only to store word meanings while I read the works of Robin Hobb. It was a beautiful app but not a great option for general note taking.\nAn app that was almost perfect was Notebook by Zoho. It was a great experience to use. Notes were arranged into notebooks, several media attachments could be made, and the editing, though not markdown, was quite good. It offered sync to servers of Zoho and also had a desktop web version. However, It just felt a little off. The app seemed that it was a bet project which lacked polish and the web version was just OK, the web-clipper was terrible.\nI also used iAWriter. The greatest plus was the ability to sync to Google drive. But since Google drive does not have a sync app for Linux and the web version of Drive displays markdown as a bunch of unprocessed text just irritates the hell out of me. I do like the swipe navigation, minimal look, night mode with absolute blacks and export options of iAWriter. But a weird bug related to switching to different application makes you loose the note that you just typed for last half hour just made me feel helpless. The same happened when you switched different device orientations. With such a critical flaw, I simply decided to move on.\nI moved on again. And I finally have setup a workflow for storing notes that I can see myself use in the near future. Although, like always, I will switch to the next hot thing :wink:.\nThe setup\nI use Typora to write notes on Laptop. It is a brilliant markdown editor and one of the primary reasons I prefer the current setup. Typora is built on electron but since I do not use an ancient PC anymore, I do not need to worry about electron apps taking too much RAM on my laptop. Typora is currently in beta and is available for free. Similar text editors exist and you can use those as well. But having tried a few, I find typora very polished and reliable. I use it even to write my blog posts. In fact, this very blog post was written on Typora.\nIt has all the basics right. A minimal interface, themeable, relatively fast, different edit modes, syntax highlighting for code bocks, emojis, math support with latex syntax, shortcuts for markdown syntaxs, and inline display of image urls. What more can you ask for from a text editor? Git integration maybe :thinking:. And I even made a theme for Typora to match my system.\nOn the Android side, I have gone completely sadistic. I use Keep to store the quick thoughts that I come across and since keep is very usable and quick, I do not need a completely overpowered app for android.\nSync\n\n\"But they are two completely different applications, How do you sync them?\"\n\nSimple answer, Manually. I do not need to write down everything I usually just put small hints and important points on Keep and then copy them over to my desktop editor by using Keep's fairly decent web interface. Then I finally edit and store the good version if the note. It is a hard thing, and I do not have my notes as editable on mobile but it is an acceptable compromise to make, At least for me.\nNow comes the real magic. Sync from desktop to Github. Unless you have been living under a rock you may know that Github recently announced free unlimited repos with at most three collaborators. This means that although you can't move your exponentially increasing startup to GitHub for free, you can move personal stuff If you weren't a student developer already. With the announcement of free private repos, you can reliably store your data on github just like all your code and GitHub is good enough to provide a decent web experience while reading markdown files.\nBut the hard part is to sync the local repo. If you have ever used git, you would know that to actually save your work, You have to Save the file -&gt; Add it to staging -&gt; Write a decent Commit message -&gt; Push it to github -&gt; Provide password if using HTTP. This whole chore is enough to drive anyone crazy. But there are ways to avoid this. And here I present my solution:\nI use a bash script to automatically check for any changes to files, then add them to staging, commit them using a somewhat descriptive message, then pull any changes on github, finally push to github. I have also configured cache credential store for git that saves the github login passwords so that I do not have to enter it manually. Then finally, I have added a cronjob for every 15 minutes to run the sync script so It updates my notes to github automagically.\nHere is the bash script:\n#!/bin/bash\n\ngstatus=`git status --porcelain`\n\nif [ ${#gstatus} -ne 0 ]\nthen\n\n    git add --all\n    git commit -m \"$gstatus\"\n\n\tgit pull\n    git push\n\nfi\n\nThe beauty of this script is the git status --porcelain command. It outputs a concise message about all the files that were modified. It can be used for both checking that if there was any change in the folder and also as a commit message.\nWith the sync setup, I had to copy all the notes from previous services cause why not. It was just a matter of copy and paste. I am now left to my imagination to fill the repo with future notes.\nHappy Note taking\n","id":"http://127.0.0.1:1111/posts/moving-notes-to-github/","title":"Moving Notes to Github"},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/posts/my-experience-with-linux/":{"body":"cover:\nimage: /blag/images/penguins-cover.jpg\ncaption: Penguins! The ever present symbol of Linux | Photo by Yuriy Rzhemovskiy on Unsplash\nstyle: wide\ntags: - linux - programming\nI would like to share My Linux experience here and how I finally ended with Ubuntu Mate.\nI am an Indian college fresher now (20 Dec 2017).\nI got my first computer when I was in 3rd Standard (aged 7 or 8). It was a HCL PC preloaded with Windows XP. But somehow the seller had removed the orignal activated one, and installed another pirated version of XP with several softwares. I used the computer for several years just to play games online and do stupid stuff. I was completely ignorant of anything like Linux and Free software. India still faces this problem, very few know about the free open source softwares.\nThe PC had a Intel Pentium processor, 2 GB of RAM, and a 1600x900 resolution display, 300GB Hard Disk. No Discrete Graphics.\nBut this changed when I moved to Agra, the city of Taj. There in my seventh or eighth standard, A guy boasted about how his OS was linked to the PC’s motherboard and how if it went corrupt it could burn the entire motherboard. I was intrigued by it, I knew nothing about operating systems other than Windows. That was my age when I had newly realised that I could search the web and learn from it (I had self-learned a very little html from the internet). I inquired and he named the OS as Ubuntu (He pronounced it You-buntu).\nI searched about this OS and It came out as just another operating system, the catch being it was free. I remember the release of Ubuntu I downloaded, it was Saucy Salamander (13.10). The name itself was quite interesting it itself. And then on a 3GB/month internet I downloaded the release (About 800+ MB).\nAnd then I installed it from a Disc, It was Great. It was fast, new, and more efficient than Windows 7 that I ran on the PC. I used it for a lot of time, but since it could not run MS office, or any games that I loved I simply removed it by deleting the partition and then unfortunately screwing up with grub, I had to reinstall Windows 7.\nI then used my PC normally for a year or two, but later the PC performed poorly on windows, It ran slow, terribly slow. So I reinstalled Ubuntu and then I discovered the free software community, And wow was it amazing.\nI then got to know that there were several alternatives to popular Windows only apps. I also came to like the free software foundations Principals. I till then still didn’t know of various other Linux Distros.\nOn a day just browsing the web, I came to a page of best Linux distros, I read it and then searched on google about “Distros”. I then understood that I had a choice to install different distros and different Desktop Environments. I searched a lot and Elementary OS attracted my attention. It was new then and it was very pleasing to look at. It also was quite user-friendly, (My family wasn’t much enthusiastic of me installing a different OS (according to them) every once in a while).\nI installed the Elementary OS and it was great. It lacked many Unity features but it still worked for me. I was delighted by it. I learned Python and C++ on elementary OS. This was also the time when I first contributed to an Open Source project, I designed the Icon for Mark My Words (an elementary app). I then contributed a little here and there.\nI later tried installing the newer Release of Freya 0.3.1. It didn’t install for some reason and I had to look for other options. I looked for Ubuntu again, but this time I looked at its other flavors.\nI first booted Ubuntu Gnome and I disliked it straight away, it was the gnome shell. I then turned to Kubuntu, it had the new and flashy+modern KDE 5. And boy it looked awesome. It didn’t run Gnome apps that good (they looked horrible). And KDE5 was still quite buggy and unstable, I think they might have fixed it now. I used Kubuntu for two to three months before looking for other options.\nAnd then by miracle I discovered Ubuntu Mate. I read an article in OMG Ubuntu about the UMate becoming an official flavour. I researched (a synonym for Googled) about Umate and I found it quite pleasing, just the right apps in a minimal distro. I installed it and I was hooked.\nI then never worried about anything. I installed 16.04 later and removed Windows for good, since it was a LTS release. I was actually quite fed up reinstalling different OSes and I wanted stability from then on. I worked later on Ubuntu Mate for everything, mostly programming. (I even customized their community website and added a few wallpapers to some releases).\n\nI used the username @adiultra back then, now I have switched to @xypnox\n\nThen this year December 2017, I bought an XPS 15 for college. It was worth a fortune but I am quite happy with it. Also the first thing I did was dual-boot Umate 16.04.3 on it. I have not completely removed windows on this because I sometimes get MSOffice files which don’t go so nicely with Libre Office. And yes I wanted a little gaming once in a while.\nI still am not perfectly happy with UMate and I think a few things can be improved here and there, But its far better than Windows. In fact UMate launches Atom in less than 2 seconds while Windows takes a good load of 12 seconds (on a hyper powerful laptop).\nSo this was my tale with Linux.

I am not against you making money, I am against the policy that you suckers have used to make it. How is it even acceptable in this world of privacy that your beloved company makes the details of registration available to everyone, when every single competitor of yours adds this feature as a default.\nAnd please don't say that I am inexperienced, I am, but I am also a happy customer of Google Domains, who have been very conveniently keeping my privacy out of the hands of you guys. You know why people these days fear that their private life might become public? Because of you and your company.\nI accept that I made a mistake to trust in your company and I deeply apologize for the same. Also, I accept that I should have read the entire terms and conditions before registering the domain.\nAnd I request you to please delete the domain name registration from under my name. I do not want that domain name, and if I ever do, I will buy it from any other domain provider. I will also try to inform as many people around me as possible about your fraudulent business policy and the complete disrespect of basic human privacy, and to never ever use any of your services.\nNOTICE:\nYOUR PREMIUM XYPNOX PRIVACY PROTECTION HAS EXPIRED.

It is not even a series of books, it is a universe in which several series written by the author Robin Hobb take place. I completed three series out of five main series released till now. And I have thoroughly enjoyed her work. The books are very easy to recommend and are considered classics among recent fantasy novels. I will try to keep this review as free from spoilers as I can.\nThe world of the elderling represents a medieval society mixed with dragons, pirates and the slight touch of magic. The stories or I should say epics begin smoothly and are carried forward effortlessly. It never feels like the author was trying to make a point or desperately moving the story forward in a single direction. It feels as if you are watching a natural progression of events. The smooth and tranquil writing style of Robin Hobb is the best part amongst a stellar set of novels.\nThe first series, The Farseer Trilogy, depicts the life of Fitz Chivalry Farseer from boyhood to young adult. The story is narrated in first person, and at several intervals you will find yourself nodding at the judgement of the protagonist. You will find very slight magic throughout the story, completely different from the bespoken Harry Potter novels which have magic as their central theme. You will relate to every character in the novels and find them similar to people you meet everyday. Take note that actions in one series affect the others as well.\nThe second series, The Livship Traders Trilogy, follows the story of the Bingtown traders, the pirate isles, the Rain wild traders and the state of Jamalia. It is narrated in third person and frequently switches between several protagonists. The number of characters developed in this series is staggering. You may even feel overwhelmed while reading the first few books, since at first the stories feel disjointed. But they come together beautifully in the end and it contains some of the most cry able moments in any novel that I have ever read. Lookout for the words of Sa while reading this series, not because they impact the story but because they are filled with wisdom.\nIf you missed Fitz in the second series, you will love the third series, The tawny man trilogy. This follows Fitz and the farseer reign after the aftermath of the Red ships war from the first series. This series finds Fitz contemplating his decisions of the old. The series is filled with introspection and high tension. The events in this series tie together events of the previous two series and present a mesmerizing epic. The relationship between the fool and the Fitz presents yet another endearing examples of Friendship.\nThe works of Robbin Hobb have a general slow theme. The events happen slowly and the environments are immersive. The author takes ample time to develop the characters. The environments are vivid, and the author takes great time to make you hear the sounds, smell the smells and taste the tastes of everything noteworthy. You will have a true experience of living the Castle life, from the life of guards to the that of the Kings and more importantly Assassins.\nI agree that these books are lengthy and consume a lot of time to read. But for someone looking for months of endearing fantasy, these are an easy recommendation. If you ever find yourself to be trapped by the never ending narrative, just finish the book, you will find yourself immersed in the next book before you know.\nThis series is an open recommendation to everyone who loves to read.\nI will leave you with a quote that I love:\n\nHe shook his head pityingly. “This, more than anything else, is what I have never understood about your people. You can roll dice, and understand that the whole game may hinge on one turn of a die. You deal out cards, and say that all a man's fortune for the night may turn upon one hand. But a man's whole life, you sniff at, and say, what, this naught of a human, this fisherman, this carpenter, this thief, this cook, why, what can they do in the great wide world? And so you putter and sputter your lives away, like candles burning in a draft.”\n“Not all men are destined for greatness,” I reminded him.\n“Are you sure, Fitz? Are you sure? What good is a life lived as if it made no difference at all to the great life of the world? A sadder thing I cannot imagine. Why should not a mother say to herself, if I raise this child aright, if I love and care for her, she shall live a life that brings joy to those about her, and thus I have changed the world? Why should not the farmer that plants a seed say to his neighbor, this seed I plant today will feed someone, and that is how I change the world today?”\n“This is philosophy, Fool. I have never had time to study such things.”\n“No, Fitz, this is life. And no one has time not to think of such things. Each creature in the world should consider this thing, every moment of the heart's beating. Otherwise, what is the point of arising each day?”\n― Robin Hobb, Royal Assassin\n\n","id":"http://127.0.0.1:1111/posts/the-elderling-realm/","title":"The Elderling Realm"},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/posts/the-secret-of-life/":{"body":"There is no secret of life.\nFirst forgive yourself,\nof the mistakes that haunt you.\nThen become what you always wanted to be,\nOr try to be as close to it as possible.\nBe humble and friendly.\nReceive what you get with open hands,\nAnd know the value of what you have,\nAnd try to share it too.\nOf all the versions of you,\nWho might have been,\nBe the best you could be.\nCompete with yourself,\nCollaborate with everyone.\nCelebrate what you can, when you can, even when you can't.\nFor happiness and joy, need little reasons.\nYou are responsible for yourself.\nBe kind.

You can skip the boring backstory and jump right into installation if you want to.\n\nThe project's source code is available at GitHub\n\nBackstory\nI recently switched to i3 windows manager just to try it out. And I loved it. I have now become used to living in the terminal. Most of the work except web browsing can be done through the terminal in an efficient way. But i3 is a topic for another post.\nI was using TickTick for managing my todos till this point. Since TickTick doesn't have a native linux interface, it was a pain to use on the desktop. Sure it had extensions for both chrome and firefox and had great sync capabilities but if you wanted to use it you had to open a whole browser and use the mouse to open the TickTick extension. It took a lot of time just to add a todo, which should be a very easy task in and of itself.\nHence I started looking for a commandline todo app that could sync to Android. It should be simple and fast, thats it, and guess what I couldn't find one single app that could do it. Most apps didn't even have a native linux app let alone cli. Those fast cli apps were mostly single bash or python scripts and could not sync at all. The GUI todo apps for linux were essentially like text editors huge and clunky.\nHence I set forth to make one of my own which centered on speed, ease of use, sync capability and customizability. And it should obviously be crossplatform.\n\nSync doesn't work yet\n\nInstallation\n\nCommand enetered in terminal have a $ before them. The output of the terminal doesn't have the $.\n\nYou can install todx using pip:\nIf you are using Ubuntu or a Ubuntu based distro:\n$ pip3 install todx\n\notherwise:\n$ pip install todx\n\n\nBy default Ubuntu's pip is for python2 and hence we need pip3 to install the todx for python3\n\nTo check if it installed correctly run the command:\n$ todx --version\n\nIt should return something like TodX v0.1.2. If it shows any error message file an Issue in the github repo.\nUsage\nYou can view your todos using the simple command:\n$ todx\n\nIf you have just installed todx, you wont get any output.\nTo add a new todo run:\n$ todx add Make a great website\nAdded todo:  ☐  Make a great website\n\nThis will add a new todo \"Make a great website\". You can run todx again to see that the new todo has been added. The empty box ☐ is not a missing unicode charecter, it is a checkbox and it indicates that the todo has not been marked yet.\nTo mark a todo run:\n$ todx mark\n0 ☐  Make a great website\n\nWhich todo you want to mark: 0\nWhat is your new status: v\n\nThis command lists the todos with indexes and asks which todo to mark. Here we choose the 0 and then the command asks what the status you want to be.\nHere we have chosen v since it closely resembles the tick. When todx displays the todos it changes the v to a ☑. Neat. But what if you prefer ☒? Just use x instead of v. To unmark a todo just use a space in the status.\nNow if you run todx you will see that once you marked your todo you can't see it. This is because by default todx only shows unmarked, in other words, not done todos. If you want to view all the todos, marked and unmarked you can run:\n$ todx view\n☑  Make a great website\n\nNow lets create another todo:\n$ todx add oops i did it again\n\nOh no. I didn't wish to create this todo.\nYou can delete it using:\n$ todx del\n0 ☑  Make a great website\n1 ☐  oops i did it again\n\nWhich todo you want to delete: 1\nAre you sure buddy? [Y/n] Y\n\nYou select your todo just like in the todx mark command. And then it confirms wether you really want to delete your todo. (ProTip: If you just press Enter at the confirmation, it assumes yes)\nJust run todx or todx view to check that you have successfully deleted a todo. There is no trash feature yet so the deleted todo cannot be recovered.\nThis much is everything you need for a simple basic commandline todo app.\nTodX is simple yes, but not basic.\nAdvanced commands\nYou mave have noted the absence of quotes while using the todx add command. You can definetly do todx add \"Some todo\" but it takes time to add those quotes and it doesn't feel elegant. Hence todx is designed in a way to eliminate the need for the quotes. You can always use quotes if you want to be more pragmatic.\nYou can use -a instead of add and -m instead of mark.\nTags\nLet us say you want to organize your todos. Say that you want to sepearate your homework todos from your personal projects. It would be nice to have two different todo lists for both. But maybe you might have two lists of holiday and thing to buy, now if you want to add a todo Buy a swimsuit You may want to add it to both of your lists, but this will introduce redundancy.\nTo simplify this problem, todx uses tags. Each tag starts with a + followed by a word, if there are several words use dashes to join them. You can add a tag to a todo while creating it by simply writing +tagname anywhere after the add command. (Although it is recommended to add them at the last since it is how they are displayed)\nSo lets add a todo with a tag:\n$ todx add Complete math homework +school\n\nWhen you view the todos:\n$ todx\n☐  Complete math homework  +school\n\nLet us add another todo:\n$ todx add Make science project +school +projects\n\nNow to view todos of only project tag, use the command:\n$ todx +project\n+ project\n☐  Make science project\n\nWow, It only displays undone todos of tag project. What if you want to view all todos? Just run:\n$ todx view +project\n+ project\n☐  Make science project\nSync\nAll the data of todx is stored in a single data.json file (in linux located at ~/.local/share/todx/data.json). Since this file is a json, it can be easily synced with a remote server and can be used in any other app that might support the json format. Android and Web apps can de made that use this extendability.\nCustomizability\nCurrently things like done markers that define which status elements are marked as done and unicode charecter replacements (☐, ☑ etc) are stored in settings.py in the main code. I intend to make a settings.json file similar to data.json to add user customizability.\nThe Bash setup\nSince todx is commandline tool we can easily mix and match it with other commandline tools to create beautiful things. I created a simple script to run everytime I start my terminal telling me the current weather, a smal quote and my todos. Here is a screenshot:\n\nWhat I learnt\nIt was and is an exhilarating project. I leant a lot of new stuff and revised old python skills in the process. Firstly I got to finally and successfully save and load data from json files into userdefined python objects.\nNext I got to know about appdirs package which let me use default os directories to save datafiles.\nI also learnt how to process command line parameters and install the package as a binary rather than just a library.\nAnd finally I got to learn about the python packaging tools. I learnt how to make a package and how to publish it to pypi. Fun fact : TodX is listed in the pypi. Making a python package takes some getting used to and can be daunting for many beginners. I almost quit my plan putting the package on pypi in the process. Perhaps I would make a blogpost describing the process.\nThe Future?\nIndeed this is just the beginning of TodX. I have several plans about todx which I would like to implement as soon as I get time to work on it. Some of them include:\n\nMaking a server and syncing data.json\nAdding tests\nAdding tty colors to make the program more beautiful\nAdding created time and due date with support for notifications\nHopefully creating a simple android app to sync with (currently TodX runs nicely in Termux)\n\n","id":"http://127.0.0.1:1111/posts/todx-the-todo-manager/","title":"TodX : The Todo Manager"},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/posts/two-pens/":{"body":"cover:\nimage: /blag/images/two-pens.jpg\ncaption: Photo by pulkit jain on Unsplash (Modified)\ntags: - poem\nIn a busy school,\ntwo friends sat together\nin mutual distrust.\nEach buying the same\nluxury pen last weekend\nand that hurt\ntheir swag level.\nThe first of the two\nused the pen far and few\nthe second didn't.\nHe abused the pen\nto scratches and scuffs\nhaving no care at all,\nfor him, it was\njust another pen.\nDays passed, Weeks passed.\nThe first's pen shinned,\nwhere the seconds dulled.\nJealousy rose again\nin second's heart.\nHe was silent and discrete\nand switched his pen\nwith the first's!\nThe first discovered however\nthe second's crime.\nHe ran to the teacher\nwith teenage whine.\nThe teacher was already tired\nSaid that the pens were the same\nand punished the first\nfor being so lame.\nThe first swallowed the truth\nand took the pen that\nthe second misused.\nHe dumped the pen\nwith scratches and scruffs\ninto the dustbin\neven if it worked just fine\n\"Because it wasn't mine\".\nThe next day, the first returned\nBlood filled with anger\nand eyes with revenge.\nHe took the pen\nthat the second stole\nand twine in half\nthe beauty parted in two.\nHe stood there\nwith the pen he cared for\nfor days, for weeks\nbroken in his hands\nand eyes wet with tears.\nFor love is strong\nbut weak in the face of hate.\n\nInitially, I thought of writing what I understood from the poem.

It is the method used to make text readable, legible, beautiful and meaningful. Good typography is readable. No matter how stylish and polished your font is, if it isn't readable no one is gonna read it.\n\nThe beauty of type lies in its utility; prettiness without readability serves neither the author nor reader. - James Felici\n\nThe main way in which we style our texts is with fonts. Fonts are more or less a complete set of glyphs for characters that can be used to render the text.\nAlthough fonts are the most common way to change the text, it is necessary to note that there are many many ways to make text look different without changing it's font. Some examples are size, weight, kerning, color etc.\nThere are a ton of things related to typography including: stroke stem ligature etc. understanding of which is not necessary to make good design. All we need to know is which fonts and what style is necessary for the job at hand.\nThe basics\nUse as little as required. This is a general advice while designing anything however this is especially true for typography. Many people go over the board when they discover the plethora of fonts available at their disposition, and they use every font they can find. Which ends up looking quite ugly.\n\nLess is more\n\nSee which fonts go together, try to use a few or even a single font family. You can use styles such as caps, italics, weight, color etc to differentiate the text.\n\nIn comparison look into the same content with same alignment and positioning as before but the use of only Roboto font family:\n\nObserve that even though it isn't as eye-catching as the previous example, at least the eyes aren't catching fire either i.e. it is far more readable to the user. Also note the usage of weight, color and kerning. They provide a guide for the eyes to follow, the main heading is the largest and bold, attracting the eye towards it. The paragraph then follows. The Navbar that cannot be confused with anything else due to its positioning at the top.\nSimilar things look similar different things look different. Buttons should have similar look and fonts, Links should be colored and highlighted similarly.\nSimplicity is not just meant for the style, your content should also apply minimalism. You do not need many complicated words to explain something to the user. You can even use icons to make it more understandable. But do not over do it. Provide text wherever required and use clear language.\nColor is a sensitive topic. Some people like this color some that. In typography it isn't quite hard to decide what the colors should be. Firstly, any long form content should have a flat color; gradients and effects reduce legibility. Everything else can be based on the color scheme of the project. Say your blog had a red/warm color scheme, one example of using the color scheme could be:\n\nPersonal Picks\nHere are a list of fonts that I really like. They are all free to use for everything.\nInter\n\nThe time I experienced this font I was in love. It is like a modern version of Helevetica with subtle improvements for visibility. This font can be used everywhere from headings to paragraphs to UI and brand text. The versatility and looks make this one of the best overall fonts out there.\nManrope\n\nThis is a pleasing font at all sizes. It is a mix of geometric and neo-grotesque, which gives it an average look. It is a versatile font and can be used in any situation. Various weights mean more flexibility. It sometimes looks awkward with a few specific characters, let us hope it gets better as it is an ongoing project.\nJost*\n\nThe geometric free font. It is a modern take on the classic Futura. It's shape and proportions have a fresh feel to it. One of my most loved fonts. It makes for a great use anywhere font. With the advent of geometric fonts in modern design, Jost is a nice font to consider for your next design.\nIosevka\n\nWith a mechanical and elongated look, Iosevka is beautiful and readable. I use it more that I would like to admit. This is the default monospace font on my system and is used throughout the interface from coding and terminals to everywhere such as status bars. (Customizations on linux are usually referred to ricing. See r/unixporn for examples.) I also use this in my text editor Typora (theme here). In fact, the font used to type this article in is none other than Iosevka!\nLato\n\nLato is a humanist sans serif font. It's rounded solid nature gives it vibes of summer. It is versatile and looks transparent in body while being distinct in headings. A truly universal typeface with support for several unicode languages, lato deserves the credit for the popularity it has.\nHK Grotesk\n\nHK Grotesk is a visually attractive and sharp grotesk sans typeface. It brovides a solid and industrial look. All caps looks particularly pleasing. A must use font to spice up the interface.\nPlayfair Display\n\nA stylish and multipurpose heading and banner font. It looks funky and professional at the same time. It is balanced and restrained in a casual fashion. You should be careful not to use it everywhere though.\nRoboto\n\nThe classic android font and one of the most used open fonts available. It is Google's take on Helevetica, built for the 2.5 billion android devices, it was designed to be incredibly flexible and readable at the same time. A great font to use when you don't know what to choose. There are other members of Roboto family that you can also check out: Roboto Slab, Roboto Condensed, and Roboto Mono.\nResources\nThere are various good places to look through to find both inspiration and advice regarding typography, here are the best ones I know:\n\nUnderstanding Typography - Material Design\nTypography guidelines and references - Smashing Magazine\nTypography Tips\nTypography - Canva\nr/typography\nTypography Shots - Dribbble\n\nAnd here are some places you can grab fonts for free:\n\nGoogle Fonts\nOpen Foundry\nBest free fonts - Website Planet\nDafont Warning: Several of these fonts may not be available for commercial projects\nFont Library\nNerd Fonts\nAlternative Google fonts for premium fonts\n\nI also have a gist of a list of fonts that I prepared a few months back while searching for fonts. It may turn out useful for some font hunters.\n\nThere are tons of more theory and practice in the field of typography, you can even go ahead and make your own font, like I did. But I feel that I have covered the most important aspects of typography here. And the provided links and resources are enough for a head-start.\n\n“Type is a beautiful group of letters, not a group of beautiful letters.” - Matthew Carter\n\nAs always, suggestions and additions are welcome.\n","id":"http://127.0.0.1:1111/posts/typography/","title":"Typography"},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/posts/xkcd/":{"body":"cover:\nimage: /blag/images/angular_momentum.jpg\ncaption: Angular Momentum\nstyle: normal\ntags: - comic - fun\nSome of the best XKCDs, there are many more at : xkcd.com\nPS: Its my favorite webcomic!\nAngular Size\n\nAncient Stars\n\nAltitude\n\nApproximations\n\nBeliefs\n\nCompass and Straightedge\n\nComplex Conjugate\n\nConvincing\n\nCreepy #RelatableAF\n\n","id":"http://127.0.0.1:1111/posts/xkcd/","title":"XKCD"},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/quotes/":{"body":"\nThese are a collection of Quotes, some mine, some salvaged from others.\n\nI don't mind your thinking slowly; I mind your speaking faster than you think. - Wolfgang Pauli\nSometimes, we have to take the paths we hate the most to get to places we most like. - @xypnox\nWith great power comes great trouble.

And my first email was from yahoo.com (Which by now is most probably destroyed). It had the most common naming scheme, namely, your name followed by your birth year.\nBut as time passed, I moved on to Gmail, and I made a new email. It also went along the lines of the well-known name + year scheme. But I was getting tired of the long email and most importantly of my teenage browsing habits that had collectively subscribed to enough services that it was impossible to filter the important emails from promotions.\nSo, being the smart person I was, I didn't unsubscribe to these services. Rather, I created a new email that I planned to use for serious work! It was adityaultra4 @ gmail.com. I chose ultra because obviously, it was cool and 4 because it was one of my favorite numbers. (At least it's better than adityarocking2000)\nI used the adityaultra4 username in almost all things I signed up for, Github, Twitter etc, etc. But, then I ran into a problem. By some way or another, I used the shorter version adiultra in some services instead of the longer adityaultra. This slight mismatch infuriated me.\nThe Search\nHence, one day, out of the blue, I decided that enough was enough and I wanted a new alias. Something short that I could use everywhere. At that time I was a huge fan of Greek mythology, having read the Percy Jackson series. I used google translate to look up for cool greek words. I translated all the hyper-ultra-super-awesome-sounding words into greek and tested whether they were taken or not.\nThe most difficult service to get a username is Gmail. Almost all the Greek words were already taken (Thanks helpful people of Greece), so, I started using variations. Slight changes to words that won't deviate much and will be sure to not have a registered account. More importantly, they should be pronounceable, because my favorite webcomic was named by using four random letters (xkcd), and when I recommend it to people they mostly take it for a nerdy geek thing.\nThe Greek word that I finally stumbled upon was έξυπνος (éxypnos). It means smart, clever, ingenious etc in English. Perfect! But the e in the beginning wasn't too nice. So, I removed the e and It now also meant Awake! Obviously, xypnos was already taken on Gmail. So, I had to improvise again. This time removing the last letter and replacing it with the good old x. And xypnox was finalized.\nLogo\nI needed a logo, an image for my profile pictures. Something that spoke of xypnox when people saw it. And for apparent reasons, I choose the greek chi χ. I could use any color I wanted and it was easy to scale, it looked good at both small and large sizes.\n\nViola! xypnox was available at all the services that were relevant to me and I quickly set up an account for them as soon as possible.\n\nNow, I have pretty much a very consistent username system for me. So, good that if you Google xypnox all the content to show up would be mine.\nThat is the one and only story of me getting the name xypnox.\n","id":"http://127.0.0.1:1111/why-xypnox/","title":"Why xypnox?"}},"docInfo":{"http://127.0.0.1:1111/":{"body":0,"title":1},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/about/":{"body":62,"title":0},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/pages/":{"body":0,"title":0},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/posts/a-beautiful-morning/":{"body":42,"title":2},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/posts/apps-that-i-love/":{"body":562,"title":2},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/posts/chessproblems/":{"body":201,"title":3},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/posts/design-tips/":{"body":499,"title":2},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/posts/designing-a-poster/":{"body":1127,"title":2},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/posts/fontstaller/":{"body":335,"title":1},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/posts/happy-new-year/":{"body":36,"title":3},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/posts/lonely/":{"body":81,"title":1},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/posts/losing-things/":{"body":40,"title":2},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/posts/misfits/":{"body":52,"title":1},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/posts/moving-notes-to-github/":{"body":932,"title":3},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/posts/my-experience-with-linux/":{"body":504,"title":2},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/posts/nettigritty-fraud/":{"body":260,"title":2},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/posts/one-of-the-dark-days/":{"body":78,"title":3},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/posts/the-elderling-realm/":{"body":473,"title":2},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/posts/the-secret-of-life/":{"body":210,"title":2},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/posts/todx-the-todo-manager/":{"body":785,"title":3},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/posts/two-pens/":{"body":143,"title":2},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/posts/typography/":{"body":662,"title":1},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/posts/xkcd/":{"body":33,"title":1},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/quotes/":{"body":401,"title":1},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/why-xypnox/":{"body":293,"title":1}},"length":25},"lang":"English"};
