Recently I was contacted by one of my friends from coaching or should I say he constantly contacted me. He then arranged a meeting in one of the nearby malls and when I arrived there I had my first experience with MLMs. Multi-Level Marketing companies.

MLMs are discribed is wikipedia as:

> Multi-level marketing (MLM) also called pyramid selling, network marketing, and referral marketing, is a marketing strategy for the sale of products or services where the revenue of the MLM company is derived from a non-salaried workforce selling the company's products/services, while the earnings of the participants are derived from a pyramid-shaped or binary compensation commission system.

_I will refer to these companies as MLMs in this article_

Essentially they are companies with a heirchal structure that aim to sell a product or service through mostly referrals and provide commissions to the people who successfully refer the product to other people.

# Proposal

Here is how it is presented to an individual. First a close friend or a known person will approach you and tell you about this new buissness that he is involved in. He will explain that the company sells some product for which you have to pay for. He will focus on how important the product is for you and how much it will boost your qualities (whichever the product is supposed to do).

The person will then tell you about the possibility that even you can join the company and then you would just have to promote the product to your friends. He will demonstrate a very simple buissness model that will result in you earning a huge sum of money in a matter of days. This will happen if you ensure that you recruit new "buissnessmen" through your newly recruited members. It is like a heirchy, a kind of a pyramid. And he will propose that you will be the center of this pyramid. He will also suggest that it will build leadership qualities and speaking abilities.

As a proof of profitability he will even show you a few people that earn an absurdly high amount of money in a seemingly impossible time. He will highlight that this method is a very easy way of working money, almost as if you are earning by just sitting at home.

# What products are on offer

MLMs offer several products from a wide variety focused on the group they aim to _exploit_. These include, but not limited in any way :

- Household appliances
- Essential oils
- Tourist packages
- Herbal Teas
- Fashion Accessories

# The Scam with me

## The Offer
The products that I was served were marketed as an educational package. The first package consisted of 84 "Computer Courses" and some 150+ articles about life, management etc. There was also a Language learning course. The other package consisted of simple Computer courses and 2 suit length (I don't know if these are complete suits or just the suit length cloth).

The packages cost as given below:
- Educational package - 16815/-
- Appearance package - 16821/-

A notable thing is that the Appearance package, which includes the suit length, also included 25 Computer courses. **25** courses just about MS Office and basic tools.

Which meant that the orignal Educational package had only (84-25 = ) 59 courses related to programming.

## Side Benefits (the actual selling point)

Anyone with a working brain would easily refuse the absurdly priced packages. And there came the mastertrick of the whole scam. The people who explained the scheme went through the description of packages in a flash. Briefly mentioning the large amount of Content and only noting the price once during the whole conversation.

They quickly moved to introduce the so called "Team" part of the scam. Here they offer a free of cost opportunity to join there team. After joining I must _recruit_ (essentially sell the packages to) two people. And recruiting them I will get 2700/- or something similar. This continues when they _recruit_ more people.
