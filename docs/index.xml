      <description>Today was a beautiful morning
The sun was shining
through a cloak of clouds.
The flowers, bright and fragrant,
were vibrant in the glow of sunlight.
The breeze was cool and calm,
Just enough to ruffle your hair.
But in the midst of the heavenly morning,
I was sad, and desolated.
Because all the beauty of the world couldn&amp;rsquo;t match yours,
And all the grief of the world couldn&amp;rsquo;t match mine.</description>

      <description>I see you down the street, alone
Walking slowly towards me
In the cold hazy wind
That twirls your hair lightly
Your eyes stare the drab pavement
Your light steps make no sound
You slightly move your hand to remove
The falling hair from your pale face
And my heart skips a beat
For a moment you lift your eyes
And we gaze at each other
I smile, but you have already looked away</description>

      <description>I would like to share My Linux experience here and how I finally ended with Ubuntu Mate.
I am an Indian college fresher now (20 Dec 2017).
I got my first computer when I was in 3rd Standard (aged 7 or 8). It was a HCL PC preloaded with Windows XP. But somehow the seller had removed the orignal activated one, and installed another pirated version of XP with several softwares.</description>
