      <description>I see you down the street, alone
Walking slowly towards me
In the cold hazy wind
That twirls your hair lightly
Your eyes stare the drab pavement
Your light steps make no sound
You slightly move your hand to remove
The falling hair from your pale face
And my heart skips a beat
For a moment you lift your eyes
And we gaze at each other
I smile, but you have already looked away</description>

      <description>I would like to share My Linux experience here and how I finally ended with Ubuntu Mate.
I am an Indian college fresher now (20 Dec 2017).
I got my first computer when I was in 3rd Standard (aged 7 or 8). It was a HCL PC preloaded with Windows XP. But somehow the seller had removed the orignal activated one, and installed another pirated version of XP with several softwares.</description>
