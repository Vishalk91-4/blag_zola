      <description>So I was interested in this chess puzzle:
In this very peculiar position we have to place the black king to a square such that it is not in check and with white being next to move black gets mated in the maximum number of moves. That is white takes most moves to mate black.
To solve such a problem, we can take help of our friend Stockfish. Using the online chess website Lichess&amp;rsquo;s analysis and editor features, we can determine the number of moves to mate for all the available squares.</description>
