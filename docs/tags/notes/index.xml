      <description>I never had a unified place to store notes earlier. I usually just remembered important things and wrote down the other things anywhere I liked. But after a year in college I could not keep on remembering everything. I should make it clear early on that I do not take extensive notes. I only jot down things that I find important like thoughts, quotes, project ideas, some literature etc. I had always looked for a simple note taking solution.</description>
