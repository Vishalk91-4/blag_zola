      <description>I fall too soon and too deep
Into waters I am unaware of.
And I forget to swim
When I need to.
I inhale the water
Knowing all well,
that it isn&amp;rsquo;t well.
And then I cry,
Try to find faults
In others when I am wrong,
And in myself when others have wronged.
I find myself
At crossroads
Where every road is a bad omen.
And yet, I have to choose one</description>

      <title>Two Pens</title>

      <description>In a busy school,
two friends sat together
in mutual distrust.
Each buying the same
luxury pen last weekend
and that hurt
their swag level.
The first of the two
used the pen far and few
the second didn&amp;rsquo;t.
He abused the pen
to scratches and scuffs
having no care at all,
for him, it was
just another pen.
Days passed, Weeks passed.
The first&amp;rsquo;s pen shinned,
where the seconds dulled.</description>

      <title>A Beautiful Morning</title>

      <description>Today was a beautiful morning
The sun was shining
through a cloak of clouds.
The flowers, bright and fragrant,
were vibrant in the glow of sunlight.
The breeze was cool and calm,
Just enough to ruffle your hair.
But in the midst of the heavenly morning,
I was sad, and desolated.
Because all the beauty of the world couldn&amp;rsquo;t match yours,
And all the grief of the world couldn&amp;rsquo;t match mine.</description>

      <description>I see you down the street, alone
Walking slowly towards me
In the cold hazy wind
That twirls your hair lightly
Your eyes stare the drab pavement
Your light steps make no sound
You slightly move your hand to remove
The falling hair from your pale face
And my heart skips a beat
For a moment you lift your eyes
And we gaze at each other
I smile, but you have already looked away</description>
