      <description>Some very beautiful things get lost and forgotten. Just as I got lost. - Luise Rainer
 We all lose things all the time, sometimes they are simple things such as an eraser, but many a times we lose significant things. I created this graph to plot the relation between how hard it is to loose something and how much hurt we feel when the thing is lost!
Enjoy! (And probably share if you like it)</description>
