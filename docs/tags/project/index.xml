      <description>I never had a unified place to store notes earlier. I usually just remembered important things and wrote down the other things anywhere I liked. But after a year in college I could not keep on remembering everything. I should make it clear early on that I do not take extensive notes. I only jot down things that I find important like thoughts, quotes, project ideas, some literature etc. I had always looked for a simple note taking solution.</description>

      <description>So, I have been working this past few weeks on a todo application using commandline interface in Python. You can skip the boring backstory and jump right into installation if you want to.
 The project&amp;rsquo;s source code is available at GitHub
 Backstory I recently switched to i3 windows manager just to try it out. And I loved it. I have now become used to living in the terminal.</description>
