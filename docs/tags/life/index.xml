      <description>There is no secret of life.
First forgive yourself,
of the mistakes that haunt you.
Then become what you always wanted to be,
Or try to be as close to it as possible.
Be humble and friendly.
Receive what you get with open hands,
And know the value of what you have,
And try to share it too.
Of all the versions of you,
Who might have been,
Be the best you could be.</description>
