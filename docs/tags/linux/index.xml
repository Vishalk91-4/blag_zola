      <description>I have had troubles installing fonts in Linux. Although its far easier than Windows where the only way to install a bunch of fonts is to open the file and click install fonts. In Linux however, you can copy your fonts to ~/.fonts or /usr/share/fonts and they will be recognized by all the applications. But can this process be improved or streamlined?
The main problem that I was facing was that while many sites offered fonts for free they were usually zipped/archived.</description>

      <description>I would like to share My Linux experience here and how I finally ended with Ubuntu Mate.
I am an Indian college fresher now (20 Dec 2017).
I got my first computer when I was in 3rd Standard (aged 7 or 8). It was a HCL PC preloaded with Windows XP. But somehow the seller had removed the orignal activated one, and installed another pirated version of XP with several softwares.</description>
