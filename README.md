*Blog of xypnox, a collection of Literature, Computing and Philosophy*

![Deployment](https://github.com/xypnox/blag/workflows/Deployment/badge.svg)

This repository contains the source for my "blag" hosted at [xypnox.com/blag](https://www.xypnox.com/blag/).

The blog is built using [Zola](https://www.getzola.org/), A static site generator written in Rust. It uses a custom theme made specifically for this blog named `xyblag`, which can be found in the [themes/xyblag](https://github.com/xypnox/blag/tree/master/themes/xyblag) directory.



## Credits

The theme used the [Even theme](https://github.com/getzola/even) as a base and was modified into it's current form.
