# The BLAGGG
![](logo.png)


This is the source code of my blag.

I have used [minimo](https://minimo.netlify.com/) Theme. Obviously I have modified it, the fonts used are [Crimson Text](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Crimson+Text) and [Josefin Sans](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Josefin+Sans).

For the logo I have used [Fredricka the Great](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Fredericka+the+Great).

to make the theme locally, use
```
hugo
```

If you want it as a local server, use
```
hugo serve -D
```

Fir questions related to Hugo visit hugo's [docs](https://gohugo.io/documentation/) and for minimo visit their [repository](https://github.com/MunifTanjim/minimo).
